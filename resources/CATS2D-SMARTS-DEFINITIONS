# CATS2D  Potential Pharmacophore Point (PPP) definitions as describes in
# Pharmacophores and Pharmacophore Searches 2006 (Eds. T. Langer and R.D. Hoffmann), Chapter 3:
# Alignment-free Pharmacophore Patterns - A Correlattion-vector Approach.
# The last lipophilic pattern on page 55 of the book is realized as a graph search and not
# as a SMARTS search. Therefore, the list contains only two lipophilic SMARTS patterns.
# The format is tab separated and contains in the first column the PPP type (D = H-bond donor,
# A = H-bond acceptor, P = positive, N = negative, L = lipophilic). The second column of each entry
# contains the SMARTS pattern(s). The last entry is a description of the molecular feature

D	[OH]	Oxygen atom of an OH group
D	[#7H,#7H2]	Nitrogen atom of an NH or NH2 group
A	[O]	Oxygen atom
A	[#7H0]	Nitrogen atom not adjacent to a hydrogen atom
P	[*+]	atom with a positive charge
P	[#7H2]	Nitrogen atom of an NH2 group
N	[*-]	Atom with a negative charge
#N	[C&$(C(=O)#8H1),P&$(P(=O)O),S&$(S(=O)O)]	Carbon, sulfur or phosphorus atom of a COOH, SOOH or POOH group. This pattern is realized by an graph algorithm
L	[Cl,Br,I]	Chlorine, bromine, or iodine atom
L	[S;D2;$(S(C)(C))]	Sulfur atom adjacent to exactly two carbon atoms
